<h1>Extreme Hohmann</h1>

extreme_hohmann.py is a program written as an exercise in object-oriented programming in VPython, where a large number of planets with their orbital distances and orbital velocities are created as instances of a "planet" class. 

A list of instances of planets are initialized using Lists of distances and initial velocities.

And for fun, a spacecraft is doing sequential Hohmann Orbital Transfers from the innermost to the outermost planet! 

The program needs VPython to run. This is an additional Python library. First you install Python, then you need to install Vpython.


To install Vpython on Linux, if you already have Python:

<code>
sudo apt-get install pip

pip install vpython
</code>

If you are using Python 3:

<code>
sudo apt-get install pip3

pip3 install vpython
</code>

For Windows users, follow the instructions on the Vpython website.
