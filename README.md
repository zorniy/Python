<h1>Extreme Hohmann</h1>

extreme_hohmann.py is a program written as an exercise in object-oriented programming in VPython, where a large number of planets with their orbital distances and orbital velocities are created as instances of a "planet" class. 

A list of instances of planets are initialized using Lists of distances and initial velocities.

And for fun, a spacecraft is doing sequential Hohmann Orbital Transfers from the innermost to the outermost planet! 

The program needs VPython to run.

To install Vpython on Linux, if you don't have it:

<code>
sudo apt-get install pip3

pip3 install vpython
</code>
